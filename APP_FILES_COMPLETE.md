# ✅ APP FILES COMPLETED!

All three app files have been filled with your actual code from the old files!

## 📁 What Was Added:

### ✅ app1.py - Setup Step 1 (Complete!)
**What it does:**
- Installs Cloudflare tunnel
- Clones ComfyUI repository
- Installs ComfyUI Manager
- Clones 30+ custom nodes
- Downloads all diffusion models (~100GB):
  - Wan 2.2 models (T2V, I2V, Animate)
  - Qwen Image Edit models
  - FP8 scaled models for efficiency
- Downloads VAE models
- Downloads text encoder models (UMT5, Qwen)
- Downloads LoRA models (LightX2V, Relight, Lightning)

**Timeout:** 2 hours (but will finish when done, not wait full 2 hours)

**GPU:** Uses `GPU_TYPE` environment variable (bot sets it dynamically)

---

### ✅ app2.py - Setup Step 2 (Complete!)
**What it does:**
- Checks if ComfyUI exists (from Step 1)
- Installs ComfyUI requirements.txt
- Installs ComfyUI Manager requirements
- Restores custom node dependencies via cm-cli.py
- Installs sageattention package
- Creates `.dependencies_installed` marker file
- **DOES NOT START SERVICES** (as requested)

**Timeout:** 20 minutes

**GPU:** Uses `GPU_TYPE` environment variable

**Important:** Only installs dependencies, doesn't start JupyterLab or ComfyUI

---

### ✅ app.py - Runtime (Complete!)
**What it does:**
- Installs Cloudflare tunnel (fresh each time)
- Clones cf-bypass-login repo for tunnel config
- Checks if ComfyUI exists
- Verifies dependencies installed
- Starts JupyterLab on port 5000 (background)
- Starts ComfyUI on port 8188 (background)
- Starts Cloudflare tunnel (BLOCKING - keeps container running)

**Timeout:** 24 hours (runs until you stop it)

**GPU:** Uses `GPU_TYPE` environment variable (H100, A100, etc.)

**URLs:**
- JupyterLab: https://jupyter.tensorart.site/
- ComfyUI: https://comfyui.tensorart.site/

## 🔑 Key Changes Made:

1. ✅ **GPU Selection**: All files use `gpu=GPU_TYPE` (bot sets via environment)
2. ✅ **Your Full Code**: Copied from your working _OLD.py files
3. ✅ **Cloudflare**: Includes your GitHub token for cf-bypass-login
4. ✅ **All Custom Nodes**: All 30+ custom nodes you had
5. ✅ **All Models**: Wan 2.2, Qwen, VAE, LoRA models (~100GB total)
6. ✅ **app2.py**: Only installs dependencies, NO service start
7. ✅ **app.py**: Starts all services, keeps container alive with cloudflared

## 📤 Ready to Upload!

These files are **100% complete** and ready to upload to GitHub!

### Upload Command (from Windows):
```powershell
cd C:\Users\User\Downloads\whatever\Antique-Bot

# Add to git (if using existing Antique-Bot repo)
git add app1.py app2.py app.py
git commit -m "Add complete app files with all models and services"
git push

# OR copy to new repo folder (if making ComfyUI-Bot-Hybrid)
# (follow the earlier instructions for creating new repo)
```

---

## 🚀 Testing Flow:

### On Ubuntu Server:

1. **Clone your GitHub repo**
2. **Install dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Configure .env** with Discord tokens
4. **Start bot**: `nohup python3 discord_bot.py > bot.log 2>&1 &`

### In Discord:

1. **Type:** `/start` → Should see button control panel
2. **Add account** → Click User Config → Add Account → Fill in Modal tokens
3. **Run setup:** `/setup` → Will run app1.py (2h) → then app2.py (20min)
4. **Start ComfyUI:** Click ▶️ Start button → Will run app.py
5. **Access:** Links will be provided (JupyterLab & ComfyUI)
